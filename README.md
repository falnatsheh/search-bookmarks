Search Bookmarks
================

'Search Bookmarks' is a simple Chrome extension to search your
bookmarks in Chrome omnibox. Type 'bm' and spacebar, then you can
start to search bookmarks.

You can install this extension at [chrome web store][1].

After I wrote this extension, I found that there is another extension
named [Bookmark Search][2] which has the exactly same feature as this
one. (even the keyword 'bm' was same). It has been there since Feb
2011. You can choose that extension over this. :)
